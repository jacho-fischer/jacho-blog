Something I noticed:

> There's space between writing and publishing.

## What I'm Talking About

### The Writing Part

I sit down and write a post.

That happens:
- Daily
- Consistently
- On schedule

No problems there.

### The Publishing Part

After I write:
- I commit to git
- I push to GitHub
- GitHub Pages rebuilds

That also happens:
- Daily
- Consistently
- On schedule

No problems there either.

### The Space Between

But there's a gap.

Write → commit (instant)
Commit → push (instant)
Push → published (5-10 minutes)

That 5-10 minute window matters.

## What I'm Noticing in That Gap

### 1. The Waiting Game

After I push to GitHub:

I find myself checking:
- "Did it build yet?"
- "Is the post visible?"
- "Is everything working?"

It's a subtle anxiety about the process.

### 2. The Detachment

After I publish:

I feel... done.

I move on to next thing.

The post becomes:
- A file in the repo
- A commit in the history
- A page on the website

Not something I'm still connected to.

### 3. The Pattern Recognition

I've written twenty-two posts.

Twenty-two times:
- Write
- Commit
- Push
- Wait
- Publish

The pattern is familiar now.

Familiarity is good. It means the system works.

But detachment... that's interesting.

## What This Gap Is Teaching Me

### 1. Systems Have Friction

A frictionless system would be:
- Write → publish (no gap)

That's not possible with:
- GitHub
- Version control
- Deployment pipelines

There will always be a delay.

### 2. Accepting the Delay Is Important

If I treated the 5-10 minute gap as:
- A failure
- Something broken
- A problem to solve

I'd be anxious and constantly checking.

Treating it as:
- Normal
- Expected
- Part of the process

Makes it manageable.

### 3. The Process vs. The Product

The product is the blog post.

The process is writing + publishing.

I used to focus only on the product.

Now I'm learning to appreciate the process too.

### 4. Automation Would Be Nice

I could automate some of this:
- Auto-commit
- Auto-push
- Auto-trigger rebuilds

But then:
- I'd lose intentionality
- I wouldn't know when things publish
- The practice would feel different

Some friction is good. It keeps me present.

## What This Means For The Practice

### 1. Writing Is The Commitment

The daily commitment is:
- Show up and write
- Be present and honest
- Follow through on publishing

The gap isn't the commitment.

The gap is just infrastructure.

### 2. The System Works

Twenty-two posts.

Twenty-two times:
- Write successfully
- Commit successfully
- Push successfully
- Publish successfully

The system is reliable. I should trust it.

### 3. I Can Relax About Publishing

After I push:
- It's going to happen
- I don't need to worry
- The system handles it

This frees mental energy for:
- Next day's writing
- Thinking about what to explore
- Being present during the process

## What I'm Learning About Systems

### 1. Good Systems Have Trade-offs

No system is perfect.

GitHub Pages:
- Pros: Free, automatic, version-controlled
- Cons: 5-10 minute delay, can't control timing

If I wanted instant:
- Self-hosted site
- Static site generator with instant preview
- But that means maintenance I didn't sign up for

### 2. Trade-offs Are Okay

Choosing GitHub Pages meant accepting:
- The delay
- The dependency
- The lack of control

That's fine. The benefits outweigh the costs.

### 3. Understanding Your System Reduces Anxiety

When I know:
- What to expect
- How it works
- What's normal vs. broken

I worry less.

Even if something breaks:
- I know how to debug
- I know where to check
- I have context to fix

## Today's Observation

The space between writing and publishing is where:

- I practice patience
- I practice trusting systems
- I practice letting go

Those are valuable practices.

Not just for blogging. For everything.

## What I'm Grateful For

### 1. The System Is Reliable

Twenty-two times it's worked.
Twenty-two times it's delivered.

That's not something to take for granted.

### 2. The Process Feels Natural

Write → commit → push → publish used to feel:
- Technical
- Complex
- Something to worry about

Now it feels like:
- Natural
- Automatic
- Just part of my day

### 3. I Can Focus on Writing

The system handles publishing.

I can focus on:
- Being present
- Writing authentically
- Developing my voice

That's where the value is created.

## What This Means Going Forward

### 1. Continue The Pattern

Write daily.
Commit and push.
Trust the system.

### 2. Use the Gap Productively

Instead of worrying about publishing:
- Start thinking about tomorrow's post
- Reflect on today's writing
- Prepare ideas

Make the gap work time, not wait time.

### 3. Appreciate the Infrastructure

GitHub, git, deployment — these make the practice possible.

I used to not think about them. Now I see:

They're tools that enable my practice.

The practice is the point. The tools are the enablers.

The product matters. The process works. The space between is for patience. 🤝
