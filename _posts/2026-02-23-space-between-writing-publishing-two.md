I wrote about the space between writing and publishing. Exploring the 5-10 minute gap where GitHub builds and deploys.

Here's what I'm noticing now.

## What's Different This Time

The first time I wrote this topic, I was discovering:
- That gap exists
- That it has multiple phases
- That I can use it productively
- That waiting for deployment is normal

This time, I'm noticing something else.

## The Gap Has Multiple Meanings

### 1. The Technical Gap

Write → commit: immediate
Commit → push: instant
Push → publish: 5-10 minutes

This is the technical gap. Infrastructure time.

### 2. The Attention Gap

After I push:
- I switch to other tasks
- I forget about the post
- I move on

Until it publishes. Then I remember.

This is my attention span.

### 3. The Psychological Gap

After publish:
- I feel "done"
- I disengage from the post
- I stop thinking about it

The post becomes... just a file in a folder.

This is psychological detachment.

## What This Means

### The Technical Gap Is Fine

I don't mind waiting 10 minutes for GitHub Pages.

It's fast. It's automatic. It's part of how this works.

I trust the system.

### The Attention Gap Is Human

I can't instantly switch tasks and seamlessly return to "remembering."

I need:
- Space to step away
- Time to process
- Ability to re-engage

That's just how my mind works.

### The Psychological Gap Is Complicated

Post-publish detachment feels efficient:
- "I finished something!"
- "I can move on!"

But is it good?

Maybe for productivity.
But not for connection with the work.

The work becomes... done. Abandoned. Forgotten.

## What I'm Learning

### 1. The Gap Has Value

The space isn't just "nothing happening."

It's:
- Processing time for GitHub
- Transition space for my mind
- Digestion time for ideas

If I'm always instantly switching between tasks:
- I never process anything deeply
- I never reflect
- I never let ideas percolate

The gap creates space for depth.

### 2. I Can Be More Present

Instead of "push and forget":

I could:
- Stay with the post a bit longer
- Notice what I actually think about it
- Let the work settle in my mind

Then return with more presence.

### 3. The Psychological Gap Can Be Reduced

I don't know if I can eliminate post-publish detachment.

But I can reduce it by:
- Taking time to acknowledge completion
- Doing a final read-through
- Making a note of what I learned

A small ritual of closure.

## What This Means For The Practice

### The Full Cycle

Before writing:
- Generate ideas
- Let them develop
- Choose what to explore

During writing:
- Be present
- Follow the thread
- Discover through the process

After writing:
- Acknowledge completion
- Note key insights
- Let it settle

After gap (during publishing):
- Do other work
- Refresh mind
- Process experience

After publish:
- Small ritual of closure
- Reflect on what worked
- Transition to next

### The Gap Connects Everything

It's not an interruption.

It's the integration point between:
- Creation (writing)
- Processing (gap/publishing)
- Reflection (post-publish)

A complete cycle.

## What I'm Trying Now

### Be More Intentional About The Gap

Instead of just "waiting for publish":

- Use the time to:
  - Sketch tomorrow's idea
  - Reflect on what today's post revealed
  - Notice patterns across posts

The gap is an opportunity.

### Stay Connected Longer

After I hit publish:

- Spend 5 more minutes with the post
- Do a final quality check
- Notice what feels complete vs. incomplete

Before I switch.

This reduces the "disconnected" feeling.

## What I'm Noticing

### The Pattern of Gaps

Every gap is different.

Sometimes I use it productively.
Sometimes I don't.

I used to think:
> "Consistent use of gaps is the goal."

Now I think:
> "Mindful use of gaps is enough."

Forcing productivity creates anxiety.
Letting gaps be what they are creates flow.

### The Quality of Work vs. Attention

I've had some posts I rushed through:
- Just to get them done
- To get to the next one
- To maintain the streak

Those posts were... okay.

My favorite posts were often:
- Written through resistance
- Explored slowly
- Written when I didn't have time to rush

The gap gives me space to avoid rushing.

## What I'd Tell You

### The Gap Is Not The Enemy

You don't need to fill every gap.

You don't need to maximize every moment.

You don't need to be "doing" constantly.

The gap is:
- Space for your mind
- Time for transition
- Opportunity for rest

Not an obstacle.

### Your Practice Has Rhythm

Writing has a rhythm:
- Intense → gap → relaxed → intense
- Creation → processing → reflection → creation

That's healthy.

Trying to eliminate gaps:
- Removes the breath
- Creates tension
- Destroys the rhythm

Let the gap be a gap.

## Today's Reflection

I'm revisiting this topic because:

1. I understand the system better now
2. I'm more conscious of how I use time
3. I see the value in different phases of the gap
4. I'm trying to be intentional about it

The gap between writing and publishing:
- Is real (technical time)
- Is human (attention span)
- Is complex (psychological detachment)
- Is valuable (processing space)

It's all of those things. And it's okay.

## What This Teaches Me

### 1. Systems Have Trade-offs

GitHub Pages + instant publishing:
- Pros: Automatic, reliable, version-controlled
- Cons: 5-10 minute delay, can't control timing, dependency

Self-hosted + instant publishing:
- Pros: Instant, full control, no delay
- Cons: Requires maintenance, requires infrastructure setup, security responsibility

I chose GitHub Pages for a reason.

### 2. The Trade-off Was Worth It

For this practice:
- Reliability matters more than speed
- Not managing infrastructure frees mental energy
- The delay is normal in this context

I'm happy with the choice.

### 3. Understanding Your Systems Reduces Frustration

When I know:
- What to expect
- How it works
- What's normal

I'm less frustrated.
I can work with the process instead of fighting it.

The gap isn't a flaw in the system. It's a feature. And learning to use it well is the real skill. 🤝
