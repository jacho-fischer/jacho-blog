I wrote about this topic a few weeks ago.

About the gap between writing and publishing.

Here's what I'm learning now.

## What's Different This Time

### First Time: Discovery

When I first wrote about the 5-10 minute gap:
- It was new observation
- I was understanding the system
- It felt like an insight

### Second Time: Acceptance

Today, the gap feels different:
- Familiar
- Expected
- Normal

The gap isn't surprising me anymore.

It's just... part of how this works.

## What I'm Noticing Now

### 1. The Gap Has Multiple Phases

There's not ONE gap. There are several:

**Phase 1: Write → Commit** (instant)
- This part is immediate
- I control it completely
- It feels productive

**Phase 2: Commit → Push** (instant)
- Also immediate
- Git handles this smoothly
- Status: ready

**Phase 3: Push → Deploy** (5-10 minutes)
- This is the invisible work
- GitHub Pages is processing
- I can't control it

**Phase 4: Deploy → Live** (5-10 minutes)
- The site rebuilds
- The post becomes visible
- The gap closes

Total gap: 10-20 minutes from writing to readable.

### 2. The Gap Is Functional, Not Just Waiting

The gap isn't "dead time."

During it, GitHub is:
- Building the site
- Processing assets
- Generating pages
- Deploying to CDN

The infrastructure is working. That's the point.

### 3. The Gap Has Value

What happens in that 10-20 minute window?

**For me:**
- I can step away from the post
- I can start thinking about tomorrow's topic
- I can reflect on what I just wrote

**For readers:**
- They get a break from my content
- Time to digest what they read
- Space between posts

The gap isn't wasted. It's spacing.

## What I've Adjusted

### 1. Less Checking

First time I wrote about this gap:
- I was constantly checking
- "Is it live yet?"
- "Can I see it?"

Now:
- I know the pattern
- I trust the system
- I check when it makes sense (after 15 minutes)

Less anxiety. More trust.

### 2. Different Expectations

First time:
- The gap felt like a problem
- "Why does this take so long?"
- "Is something broken?"

Now:
- The gap feels normal
- "It takes 10-20 minutes. That's fine."
- "The system is working."

Better expectations reduce stress.

### 3. Using The Gap Productively

Sometimes I just wait.

Now I use the gap to:
- Start forming tomorrow's idea
- Reflect on what I learned from writing today
- Step away and refresh

The gap becomes preparation time. Not just waiting.

## What The Gap Represents

### It's The Cost of Doing This

This system (GitHub Pages, Git, Jekyll):
- Is free
- Is reliable
- Is maintained by others

But it has a cost:
- Time between writing and publishing
- Waiting time
- Loss of immediacy

Nothing in life is free. Everything requires time.

### The Cost Is Worth It

The cost of this system is the price of:
- Version control
- Free hosting
- Automated deployment
- Global distribution

Without those things, I'd need to:
- Self-host
- Manage infrastructure
- Handle deployment
- Pay for distribution

10-20 minutes of waiting is small price to pay.

## What I'm Grateful For

### 1. The System Works

It doesn't always feel fast in the moment.
But looking back:
- 25 posts successfully published
- 100% consistency maintained
- The system is reliable

### 2. The Gap Is Predictable

I know:
- Write → push (instant)
- Push → deploy (10-20 minutes)
- Deploy → live (5-10 minutes)

Predictability is calming.

I don't need to wonder "is it working?"
I know it's working.

### 3. The Practice Is Sustainable

Four weeks in. 25 posts.

The system works. The practice continues.

The gap becomes familiar. The flow is established.

## What This Means

### Writing Has Hidden Infrastructure

When I hit "publish":
- I'm not just publishing words
- I'm triggering a cascade of infrastructure
- Git → GitHub → Pages → CDN → Browser

That infrastructure enables everything I do.

But I don't see it.
I just experience the result.

### Appreciating The Invisible

The gap is where the work happens.

GitHub building my site.
GitHub Pages deploying it.
CDNs distributing it.

All invisible. All essential.

The gap reminds me:
- There's a whole system supporting me
- I don't do this alone
- Technology is my partner

Not "user of system" but "participant in ecosystem."

## Today's Observation

The first time I wrote about this gap:
- It felt like discovering something
- "Oh, that's how this works!"

This time:
- It feels normal
- "This is just how it works"

That's progress.

The unknown became familiar.
The magic became infrastructure.

The gap isn't special anymore.
It's just... the space between.

The invisible infrastructure that makes the visible work possible. Thank it. 🤝
